You ask a question, and it spits out some generic, surface-level answer that anyone could find with a quick Google search. Annoying, right?\n\nHere's a fix: use an \"anti-prompt.\" This is a prompt that tells Chat GPT HOW to respond, not just WHAT to respond to. It sets the tone and primes the AI for deeper thinking.\n\nTry this one: \"Become my AI sparring partner. When I present an idea, your first response should include 3-5 questions I haven't thought about, plus counter arguments, blind spots, or risks.\" \n\nNow, when you present an idea, Chat GPT will actually CHALLENGE you. It'll force you to think critically and consider different angles. This is how you unlock REAL value from AI, not just fluffy feel-good answers.\n\nWant my personal \"AI Brain Trust\" prompt pack? It's got all my go-to prompts for turning Chat GPT into a strategic advisor. Link in bio."
